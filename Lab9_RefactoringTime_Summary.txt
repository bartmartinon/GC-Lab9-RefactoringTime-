Lists are different to Arrays given that Lists have the ability to change its element capacity while they're being added into or removed from. Arrays have a set size and cannot grow or shrink in terms of capacity.

Arrays must also be instantiated with a determined capacity, unless you know what elements it should start with. Lists can be instantiated without a specified size.

string[] array1 = new string[5];
string[] array2 = {"str1","str2","st3"};

List<string> = new List<string>();
